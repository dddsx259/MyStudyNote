## 1. How Sushi Went Global
I choose this article to comment because I'm a big sushi fan haha. I often go to the Genki Sushi at right outside Exit B2 of the HKU MTR Station. After reading Theodore Bestor’s  "How Sushi Went Global", I realized that the salmon on the rice might have come from a Norwegian farm, been priced in Tokyo, flown to Hong Kong, and finally served at my plate.

The globalization deeply influence the whole world. A small sushi can do so many things, satisfied my appetite, boost the economic development like the service industry in Hong Kong, the business in Tokyo, and the fishery in the United States and Europe, it also disseminate Japanese culture. All in all, this is personal feelings, economy and culture mixture on a global scale. Each time when I went to the Sushi restaurant, heard "irashaimase", taste the Sushi, sashimi, it's do a good experience of globalization.

I chose this article to comment on because—--To be honest, I’m a huge sushi fan! I often grab a bite at Genki Sushi right outside Exit B2 of HKU MTR Station.

After reading Bestor’s “How Sushi Went Global,” it really struck me: that piece of salmon on my plate might have come from a fish farm in Norway, been auctioned in Tokyo, flown all the way to Hong Kong, and finally served right here in front of me.

It’s amazing how something as simple as sushi connects the whole world. It satisfies my hunger, yes—but it also supports restaurants in Hong Kong, seafood markets in Tokyo, fisheries in the U.S. and Europe, and even spreads Japanese culture globally.

In fact, this reminds me of how Japanese anime and manga or comic have gone global too. Just like sushi, they’re not just “consumed”—they’re experienced as authentically “Japanese.” Fans around the world learn phrases like “kawaii” or “senpai,” collect limited-edition figures, and even cosplay — all to feel closer to that cultural aura. And just like sushi bars use “Irasshaimase!” to signal authenticity, anime cafés in Paris or Los Angeles decorate with neon signs and play J-pop to recreate a “Tokyo vibe.” Bestor’s point holds true here too: globalization doesn’t erase culture--—it turns it into a powerful, marketable brand.

In short, every time I walk into a sushi place, hear “Irasshaimase!”, and take a bite of fresh sashimi—it’s not just a meal. It’s a real-life experience of globalization, blending personal joy, economics, and culture on a truly global scale.


## 2. Globalization and Consumer Culture
我选择评论 Goodman 的这篇文章，是因为它彻底改变了我对“全球化”的理解。以前我以为全球化要么是麦当劳式的文化同质化，要么是各地文化的顽强抵抗。但 Goodman 指出，这两种看法都错了。

他提出了一个更深刻的洞见：真正的全球文化，其实是一种“消费文化”。无论我们是在巴黎买奢侈品，还是在港大附近吃平价寿司，甚至是在网上购买动漫手办，我们都在参与同一个全球性的“游戏”。这个游戏的规则很简单：我们的身份、地位乃至人生意义，越来越多地通过“消费什么”来定义和表达。

文章最让我震撼的观点是，全球化带来的同质化与异质化其实是同一枚硬币的两面。品牌商一方面在全球推广标准化的产品（比如可口可乐），另一方面又大力推行“本地化”（glocalization），鼓励我们通过消费来彰显个性和文化根源。结果就是，我们看似在追求独特，实际上却是在一个全球统一的消费框架内进行选择。就连反对全球化的行为，比如购买“反美可乐”（Mecca Cola），最终也变成了一种新的消费方式。

I chose to comment on Douglas Goodman’s chapter because it completely reshaped how I think about “globalization.” I used to see it as either cultural homogenization—like McDonald’s everywhere—or local cultures heroically resisting it. But Goodman argues that both views miss the point.

His key insight is this: to the extent that a global culture exists, it is a consumer culture. Whether we’re buying luxury goods in Paris, grabbing affordable sushi near HKU, or ordering anime figures online, we’re all playing the same global game. And the rule of this game is simple: our identities, social status, and even sense of meaning are increasingly defined and expressed through what we consume.

What struck me most is his idea that homogenization and heterogenization are two sides of the same coin. Global brands push standardized products like Coca-Cola, yet simultaneously champion “glocalization,” urging us to express our unique local identity through consumption. The result? We feel like we’re being unique, but we’re actually choosing within a globally uniform framework of consumerism. Even acts of resistance—like buying “anti-American” Mecca Cola—end up becoming just another form of consumption.


## 3. Heunggongyan Forever: Immigrant Life and Hong Kong Style Yumcha in Australia
谭素薇的这篇文章让我深刻体会到，食物远不止是果腹之物，它更是一种强大的文化实践和身份宣言。文章以悉尼的港式饮茶为窗口，揭示了香港移民如何通过这一日常仪式，在异国他乡重建“香港人”（heunggongyan）的身份认同。

最打动我的是作者提出的悖论：在全球化过程中，原本开放、包容、善于创新的香港都市文化，反而在移民社群中变成了一种需要被严格守护的“传统”。移民们执着于寻找最正宗的点心、最地道的茶楼氛围，甚至将冷冻点心买回家，都是为了“冻结”那个他们记忆中最辉煌的香港。这种对“正宗性”的追求，表面上是在怀旧，实则是在应对移民生活中的疏离、不安与文化断裂。

文章还精彩地展示了，饮茶这个看似简单的聚餐，实际上构建了一个强大的社会支持网络。对于那些因语言障碍或“太空人家庭”模式而感到孤立的移民来说，周末的茶楼不仅是吃饭的地方，更是重逢故友、交换信息、获得情感慰藉的社区中心。这让我明白，文化的传承，往往就藏在这些最平凡的日常仪式里。

Siumi Maria Tam’s chapter offers a profound insight: food is far more than sustenance; it’s a powerful act of cultural practice and identity-making. Using Hong Kong-style yumcha in Sydney as a lens, she shows how immigrants actively reconstruct their “heunggongyan” (Hong Konger) identity through this everyday ritual.

What struck me most was the central paradox she identifies: in the process of globalization, the metropolitan Hong Kong identity—once known for its openness, adaptability, and inventiveness—transforms within the immigrant community into an exclusive and rigid “tradition” that must be fiercely preserved. The quest for authentic dimsum, the bustling atmosphere of the tea house, even buying frozen dumplings from home—all are attempts to “freeze” a golden-era Hong Kong in time. This pursuit of authenticity isn’t just nostalgia; it’s a direct response to the insecurity, alienation, and cultural displacement of immigrant life.

The article also brilliantly illustrates how yumcha functions as a vital social infrastructure. For immigrants isolated by language barriers or the “astronaut family” lifestyle, the weekend tea house is more than a restaurant. It’s a community hub where old friends reconnect, information is exchanged, and a crucial sense of belonging is reaffirmed. It reminds us that cultural continuity is often sustained not through grand gestures, but through the quiet, persistent repetition of ordinary rituals.


## 4. McDonald’s in Hong Kong: Consumerism, Dietary Change, and the Rise of a Children’s Culture
詹姆斯·沃森关于麦当劳在香港的研究，彻底颠覆了我对“文化帝国主义”的简单想象。他没有把麦当劳看作一个强加美国文化的入侵者，而是敏锐地指出：香港人早已将麦当劳“据为己有”，把它变成了自己日常生活的一部分。

文章最精彩的地方在于揭示了这个“本地化”过程是如何发生的。麦当劳最初因其“异国风情”而吸引年轻人，但很快，它就从一个时髦的外来符号，变成了一个干净、可靠、人人可及的社区空间。它甚至重塑了社会规范——比如，麦当劳被认为是在香港率先推行有序排队的公共场所之一，帮助塑造了更“文明”的公共秩序。

更重要的是，沃森强调了儿童在这一文化转型中的核心作用。麦当劳通过生日派对和开心乐园餐，成功地将自己打造为“儿童专属”的快乐天地。这不仅催生了一种以孩子为中心的新型家庭消费模式，还让孩子们反过来成为父母的“文化导师”，教他们如何吃汉堡、如何融入这种新的消费文化。最终，正如文章结尾那个被遣返又重返香港的孩子喊出的“带我去麦当劳”一样，麦当劳已经不再是“美国的”，而是成为了“香港的”一种情感归属。

James L. Watson’s study of McDonald’s in Hong Kong completely overturns the simplistic narrative of “cultural imperialism.” He doesn’t see McDonald’s as an American invader imposing its culture, but rather shows how Hong Kong people have actively appropriated it, making it an ordinary and integral part of their own local life.

The brilliance of the chapter lies in detailing this process of “localization.” Initially drawn by its exotic, American flair, consumers soon transformed McDonald’s from a trendy novelty into a familiar, clean, and reliable community space. It even helped reshape social norms—McDonald’s is widely credited in Hong Kong for being one of the first public places to enforce orderly queuing, contributing to a more “civilized” public culture.

Crucially, Watson highlights the central role of children in this cultural shift. Through birthday parties and Happy Meals, McDonald’s successfully branded itself as a child-centric haven. This not only created a new family dynamic centered around children’s desires but also turned kids into “cultural tutors” for their parents, teaching them how to eat burgers and navigate this new consumer world. In the end, as powerfully illustrated by the deported child who, upon returning to Hong Kong, cried out “Take me to McDonald’s!”, McDonald’s had ceased to be “American” and had become an emotional anchor of “Hong Kong” identity itself.
