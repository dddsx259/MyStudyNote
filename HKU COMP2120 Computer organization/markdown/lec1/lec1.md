# Chapter1: Introduction
About this lecture, we will learn:
###	Basic Computer Organization:
The basic components of computers like **CPU**, **memory**, **I/O**, and their **organization**
###	Design Issues:
The cost performance tradeoff in designing memory hierarchy and instruction sets
###	Assembly Language(汇编语言) Programming:
Use assembly language simply
The relation between high level language and assembly language
###	Modern Trends:
Be able to follow the trends in computer design and appreciate the design philosophy behind it.  
## Computer Organization and Architecture:
### Organization:
Operational units and their interconnections, which realizes the architectural specification
	Architecture: Attributes of a system visible to programmer, or which have a direct impact on the logical execution of a program.
	Computer is a complex system that has:
		Computer Structure---The way in which the components are interrelated.
			Described computers in different levels that designer can only deal with a particular level of the system at a time, based on the dependence between each level and the next lower level by a simplification and abstraction.
			Internal Structure of Computer including:
	CPU (Central Processing Unit) -- controls the operation of the computer and performs its data processing functions.
	Main Memory -- Stores data/program.
	I/O (Input/Output) -- moves data between computer and its external environment.
	System Interconnection -- provides communication among CPU, main memory and I/O.
 
			Internal Structure of CPU including:
	Control Unit -- Controls the operation of the CPU.
	Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) -- performs data processing functions. 
	Registers -- provides storage internal to the CPU. 
	CPU interconnection -- provides for communication among the control unit, ALU and registers.
 
		Computer Function---The operation of each individual component as part of structure.
